## Code Style

See `AGENTS.md` for the full set of rules. The highlights:

- **Use TypeScript interfaces** over types
- **Use arrow functions** over function declarations
- **Use kebab-case** for file names
- **Use descriptive variable names** - avoid shorthands or 1-2 character names
- **Avoid type casting** (`as`) unless absolutely necessary
- **Keep interfaces/types** at the global scope
- **Remove unused code** and follow DRY principles
- **Avoid comments** unless absolutely necessary
