Sync the toolbar overlay across all open tabs and add a keep-awake coffee button.

Terminal settings (theme, font, size, line height, cursor, scrollback, padding, Nerd Font) now propagate to every other open tab the moment you change them — the same live-sync that automations already had. The new coffee button in the top-right overlay toggles a machine-wide `caffeinate -dims` keep-awake: the icon tints to a warm coffee tone when active, and because the daemon owns the single process and broadcasts its state, the toggle stays in lockstep across tabs. The button only appears on macOS, where `caffeinate` exists.
