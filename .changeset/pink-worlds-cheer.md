fix: correct emoji variation selector width during TUI streaming

Remove `terminal.unicode.activeVersion = "15"` override that was downgrading xterm.js from the grapheme-aware `"15-graphemes"` provider to the naive `"15"` provider. The non-grapheme provider fails to join U+FE0F (variation selector-16) with the preceding emoji, treating it as a phantom width-1 cell. This shifts cursor positions by +1 per emoji, causing TUI redraws to leave ghost-line artifacts.
